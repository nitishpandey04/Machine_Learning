# Linear Regression
### Assumptions of linear regression
1. linear relationship between input and target variables
2. residuals/error terms (target - predictions) are normally distributed
3. residuals are independent of each other
4. residuals have constant variance - homoscedasticity

### Hypothesis testing in linear regression 
1. To determine the significance of beta coefficients
2. H0: B1 = 0 ; H1: B2 != 0
3. T-test on the beta coefficient
4. t score = Bi / SE(Bi)

### Residual Analysis - Test for linear regression
1. Histogram of residuals to check normality - must be centered around zero and should look normally distributed
2. Plot of the residuals with X or y to check independence - shouldn't be any patterns except centered around zero
